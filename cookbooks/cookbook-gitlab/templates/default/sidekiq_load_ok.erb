# GitLab Sidekiq load check for Monit If Sidekiq reports that all its workers
# are busy for a prolonged period of time, we may have an situation where the
# queue is stuck. This can be resolved by letting Monit restart Sidekiq.
#
# This script exits immediately with status 0 if Sidekiq still has workers
# available.  If all workers are busy, we repeatedly check again after 1
# second. As soon as Sidekiq has workers available again, we exit with status
# 0. If Sidekiq keeps reporting all its workers are busy after $timeout
# seconds, we exit with status 1 to signal to Monit that a restart is needed.
